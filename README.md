# FrameCalc
Made for speedrunners
Just input the frame count of your run, and the frame rate of the video. Sometimes you might want to subtract 1 ms, as some game moderators use other ways for calculating times and most of the time they round down and not up when it comes to repeating numbers.


Big ups to: 

[slashinfty](https://github.com/slashinfty) for the math

[jani from zap](https://www.zapstudio.net/framecalc/) for javascript snippets and validation
